# DAND Projects

These are my submissions to the Data Analyst Nanodegree Program offered by Udacity.

# FYI

### How many projects are there?
There are 8 chapters in total for this nanodegree and for each chapter and the assignment for each chapter should meet the reviewer requirements in order to finish this Nanodegree. Do note that the commit date doesn't have anything to do with my submission date. I just decided to put my submission here in the middle of my progress.

### When did I take this course?
I was part of the Bertelsmann Data Science Program and this DAND starts around October 2018 and ends on February 2019.
